    <p>
        Blockchain technology is a decentralized and distributed ledger
        system that has revolutionized the way data is recorded, verified, and stored.
        At its core, a blockchain is a chain of blocks, each containing a list of transactions.

    </p>
    <p>

        One of the key features of blockchain is its decentralization.
        No single entity has control over the entire network, making it resistant to tampering or fraud.
    </p>
    <p>
        Consensus mechanisms, such as proof-of-work or proof-of-stake, are employed to validate transactions and add new
        blocks to the chain.
        This decentralization also enhances the resilience of the network, as there is no single point of failure.
